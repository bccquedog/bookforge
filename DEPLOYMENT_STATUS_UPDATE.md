# BookForge Deployment Status

## ✅ Completed

1. **Removed All Mock Data**
   - Deleted `src/lib/mockApi.ts` (455 lines)
   - Removed `USE_MOCK_API` from `src/lib/api.ts`
   - Updated `env.example` to remove mock API references
   - App now uses **100% real backend**

2. **Fixed Backend Endpoints**
   - Updated `build_book` to use project data instead of request body
   - Added camelCase → snake_case conversion for BuildConfig
   - Fixed manuscript path/URL handling for local and Firebase storage

3. **Enhanced Error Logging**
   - Added detailed traceback logging for debugging
   - Included error traces in API responses for easier troubleshooting
   - Better visibility into what's failing

## 🔄 Current Issues

Both `generate-cover` and `build` endpoints are returning **500 errors**. The enhanced logging should help us identify the root cause once Railway redeploys.

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- **Frontend**: ✅ Deployed to Vercel Production
- **Backend**: ✅ Deployed to Railway with all API keys configured
- **Health Check**: ✅ All services reporting healthy

## 🐛 Next Steps

1. Test the endpoints again after Railway redeploys
2. Check browser console for detailed error messages
3. Review Railway logs if errors persist
4. Fix any remaining issues identified by logging

## 📊 API Configuration

All API services configured and operational:
- ✅ Gemini AI (manuscript analysis)
- ✅ OpenAI DALL-E (cover generation)
- ✅ Firebase Storage (file management)
- ✅ WeasyPrint (PDF generation)

**Status**: Debugging 500 errors with enhanced logging
