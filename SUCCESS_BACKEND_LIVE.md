# 🎉 Backend is LIVE! Success!

## ✅ Current Status

### Backend (Railway) - LIVE! ✅
**URL**: https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app
**Status**: Healthy and responding!

**Health Check**: ✅ PASSING
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "BookForge API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "openai_available": true,
  "gemini_available": false,  // ← Need to add API key
  "firebase_available": false  // ← Need to add credentials
}
```

### Frontend (Vercel) - DEPLOYED ✅
**URL**: https://bookforge-i2ymsjb2t-brian-proctors-projects.vercel.app

**Note**: Still using mock API until Vercel env vars are updated.

## 🔑 Next Step: Add API Keys to Railway

Go to: https://railway.com/project/3c1f7c63-4930-48a7-9b01-077d12073576

Click on your service → **Variables** tab

Add these from your `.env.local`:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY = AIzaSyD9WYDv4J558hyj3BiM9J15cJSHr9woVcg
OPENAI_API_KEY = (your key from .env.local)
FIREBASE_CONFIG_JSON = (paste your Firebase JSON here)
```

Then Railway will auto-redeploy and:
- Gemini AI will be available ✅
- Firebase Storage will work ✅
- OpenAI (already working) ✅

## 🌐 Next Step: Update Vercel Environment Variables

Go to: https://vercel.com/brian-proctors-projects/bookforge/settings/environment-variables

Add:
```
VITE_API_BASE = https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app
VITE_USE_MOCK_API = false
```

Then redeploy frontend (or it will auto-redeploy).

## ✅ What's Working NOW

- ✅ Backend server running
- ✅ Health check passing
- ✅ API endpoints responding
- ✅ OpenAI integration ready
- ✅ Server starts even without WeasyPrint (graceful degradation)
- ⏳ Gemini: Need API key
- ⏳ Firebase: Need credentials

## 🎯 After Adding Keys

Everything will be fully operational:
- Real Gemini AI manuscript analysis
- Firebase file storage
- Real PDF/EPUB generation (once WeasyPrint libraries are in)
- Cover generation with OpenAI

**You're 95% there! Just add the API keys!** 🚀
