# 🚨 Immediate Action Needed

## The Problem
Railway has the URL but no code is deployed yet.

## 🔍 What To Do NOW

**Go to**: https://railway.com/project/3c1f7c63-4930-48a7-9b01-077d12073576

**Look for**:
- Is there a "Deploy" button?
- Is there "Connect to GitHub"?
- Any deployment activity?

**Tell me what you see!**

## 📸 Quick Screenshots I Need

1. **Your service list** - What services are there?
2. **bookforge service page** - Any deployment shown?
3. **Settings tab** - What's the root directory?

## ⚡ Quickest Solution

If you see **"Connect GitHub"**:
1. Click it
2. Select: `bccquedog/bookforge`
3. Root directory: `api`
4. Click Deploy

**I'm waiting on you to tell me what the Railway dashboard shows!** 👀
