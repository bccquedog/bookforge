# Deployment Status Check

## ✅ Frontend Deployed

**Production URL**: https://bookforge-fa9k9kfpv-brian-proctors-projects.vercel.app

## ⏳ Backend Building

**Railway URL**: https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app

## 🔍 How To Check Railway

Go to: https://railway.com/project/3c1f7c63-4930-48a7-9b01-077d12073576

Look for:
- ✅ Green deployment? Ready!
- 🔄 Building? Wait...
- ❌ Failed? Need logs

## ✅ Quick Test

Once Railway shows deployed:

```bash
curl https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "BookForge API"
}
```

## 🎯 Then

Once backend is healthy:
1. Update `.env.local` to disable mock mode
2. Redeploy frontend
3. Test full flow!
