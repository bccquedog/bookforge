# Fixed: Correct Package for Debian Trixie ✅

## 🔧 The Fix

Railway's Debian Trixie uses:
- ❌ `libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0` (old name)
- ✅ `libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0` (new name on Trixie)

## ✅ Changed Dockerfile

Changed one line:
```dockerfile
libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0  # Correct for Debian Trixie
```

## ✅ Pushed

Railway is now rebuilding with the correct package!

**This is the right package name! Build should succeed!** 🚀
