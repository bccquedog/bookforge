## âœ… What Changed

Simplified to minimal WeasyPrint requirements:

### Core Libraries Only

- `libpango-1.0-0` - Text layout
- `libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0` - Image handling
- `libffi-dev` - Foreign functions
- `shared-mime-info` - MIME types

### Build Tools
- `build-essential` - C/C++ compiler suite
- `python3-dev` - Python headers

- `pandoc` - Document conversion

### Removed

- Removed dev versions we don't need
- Using runtime packages only
- Added build-essential for compilation

## âœ… Pushed
