# Latest Fixes Applied

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Healthcheck Fixes
- Added `/health` endpoint (Railway prefers this)
- Added feature flags to health response
- Configured in railway.json

### 2. Procfile Fix
- Changed from `python` to `python3`

### 3. WeasyPrint Lazy Loading
- Server now starts even if WeasyPrint fails to import
- Graceful degradation with error messages

### 4. Debian Trixie Package Fix
- Using `libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0` (correct for Trixie)

## 🔄 Current Status

Railway is rebuilding with all fixes.

## ⏳ Wait Time

Usually takes 3-5 minutes for Railway to:
1. Detect GitHub push
2. Build Docker image
3. Deploy container
4. Run healthcheck

## 🎯 Expected Result

```bash
curl https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app/api/health
