# WeasyPrint Fix Deployed ✅

## ✅ What I Fixed

The error was:
```
OSError: cannot load library 'gobject-2.0-0'
```

**Solution**: Added WeasyPrint system dependencies to Dockerfile:
- `libcairo2-dev` - Cairo graphics library
- `libpango1.0-dev` - Text layout library  
- `libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev` - Image loading library
- `libffi-dev` - Foreign function interface
- `shared-mime-info` - MIME type handling
- `python3-dev` - Python development headers

## ✅ Code Pushed

```bash
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Fix WeasyPrint dependencies"
git push
```

## 🔄 Railway Should Auto-Redeploy

Since Railway is connected to GitHub, it should:
1. Detect the push
2. Trigger new build
3. Build with updated Dockerfile
4. Deploy the fixed version

## ⏳ Waiting For...

Railway to finish building and deploying.

**Check Railway dashboard** to see build progress!

## ✅ Expected Result

After deployment succeeds, health check should pass:
```bash
curl https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "BookForge API",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

**The fix is deployed! Waiting for Railway to rebuild!** 🚀
