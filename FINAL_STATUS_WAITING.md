# Waiting for Railway Build...

## ✅ Complete Fix Deployed

All WeasyPrint dependencies added:
- `libgobject-2.0-0` + dev (was missing!)
- Complete Cairo/Pango/GDK libraries
- Library paths configured
- All runtime and dev packages

## 🔄 Current Status

**Railway**: Building with complete library set

## ⏳ What Happens Next

1. Railway completes build (~3-5 minutes)
2. Deploys the container
3. Runs health check
4. Service becomes available!

## ✅ Test When Ready

```bash
curl https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "BookForge API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "features": {
    "gemini": true,
    "firebase": true,
    "openai": true
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Then I'll

1. Update Vercel environment variables
2. Switch from mock to real API
3. Test full flow
4. Mark production as complete! 🎉
