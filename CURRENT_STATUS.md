# BookForge Current Status

## ✅ What's Working

### Frontend (Vercel) - LIVE! ✅
**URL**: https://bookforge-qvwu49dtz-brian-proctors-projects.vercel.app
**Status**: Fully deployed and functional
- All UI features working
- Mock API mode enabled as fallback

### Backend (Railway) - Configured but Not Deployed Yet ⏳
**URL**: https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app
**Status**: Service created, but code not deployed

**Issue**: Railway has the URL but no app is running yet.

## 🔧 What Needs To Happen

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/3c1f7c63-4930-48a7-9b01-077d12073576
2. Find "bookforge" service
3. Check if it shows "Deploy" or "Connected"
4. If "Deploy" - click it to deploy from GitHub
5. Make sure root directory is set to `api`
6. Add environment variables:
   - GEMINI_API_KEY
   - OPENAI_API_KEY  
   - FIREBASE_CONFIG_JSON
   - PORT=8000

### Option 2: Deploy from CLI
```bash
cd /Users/brianproctor/bookforge
railway login
cd api
railway link --project 3c1f7c63-4930-48a7-9b01-077d12073576
railway up
```

Then add environment variables in Railway dashboard.

## ✅ Once Backend is Deployed

Test it works:
```bash
curl https://bookforge-production-2a1d.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return JSON with `"status": "healthy"`

Then:
1. Frontend will automatically connect (Vercel redeploys)
2. All features will work with real APIs
3. Gemini AI will analyze manuscripts
4. Files will upload to Firebase
